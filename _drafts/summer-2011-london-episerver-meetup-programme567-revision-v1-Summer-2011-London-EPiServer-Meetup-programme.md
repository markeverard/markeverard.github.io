Our <a title="London EPiServer Developer Meetup Summer 2011" href="http://www.meetup.com/EPiServer-London/events/22066221/" target="_blank">third London EPiServer Meetup</a> is almost upon us &#8211; (this Thursday 7th July). We&#8217;ve got a theme of &#8216;Integration&#8217; this time and three of our members have kindly volunteered to talk:

  * Paul Dunstone (from our hosts Rufus) &#8211; who will be talking about an EPiServer / SmartLogic integration that allowed for a rich and automated content classification. Paul previously [blogged](http://world.episerver.com/Blogs/PaulD/Dates/2011/2/Implementing-the-semantic-web-in-EPiServer-6-using-Smartlogic-and-the-Google-Search-Appliance-by-Paul-Dunstone--Rufus-Leonard/) about this, but this will provide a great opportunity to understand more of the technical details.

  * Raghavendra Bangalore-Govindaiah (aka Rags) &#8211; who will be presenting an overview of a COMET based pushed real-time data feed integration with an EPiServer site. For those of you who have never heard of COMET before, this should be interesting as COMET introduces a new model of working across the web. Rather than the traditional request/response cycle it uses long held http requests to allow the server to PUSH content updates directly to client web browsers.

  * Mark Everard -I&#8217;ll be giving anÂ overview of NuGet, Microsoft&#8217;s package management tool for ASP.NET / Visual Studio, including a look at how to create your own packages and integrate the creation process with your project&#8217;s build script using MSBuild.

It again should be a great night and I hope to see you a lot of you there.
