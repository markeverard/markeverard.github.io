I want to push a slightly different approach this time. It would be great if more of you would get involved. I know there is a huge amount of experience and knowledge out there and I&#8217;d love for some of you to step up and and share your experiences. Remember that not only are we EPiServer developers, we are also .NET developers, and all also web developers, so there is a really broad range of things that you could share with us. They don&#8217;t have to be long talks or even that formal. The most important thing is the sharing (just asÂ I&#8217;m sure your Mother&#8217;s always taught you!)

If youâ€™re interested then please **sign-up** and RSVP using the meetup group below.
