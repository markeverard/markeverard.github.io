One of the nice features that came along with the new CMS editing interface from EPiServer 7 is the ability to <a title="Attributes in EPiServer 7 " href="http://world.episerver.com/Documentation/Items/Developers-Guide/EPiServer-CMS/7/Content/Pages-and-Blocks/Attributes/#ImageUrl" target="_blank">define icons</a> for Pages and Blocks. These icons are used within the new editing interface and give editors a more visual way of deciding which is the right content element to use and create in their site.

## Alloy examples

The Alloy Templates starter pack contains a selection of purpose designed images, and demonstrates how useful this can be.

## The reality

The horrible reality that I’ve found is that often designing these icons becomes a low priority task for designers and that the below is an example end result! Which lets be honest, doesn’t really help editors too much.

## A solution

As part of the project we’re working on at the minute at <a title="Marie Curie on GitHub" href="https://github.com/mariecurieorguk" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>, we’ve designed a suite of 55 icons for our own implementation. However, being the nice kind-hearted souls that we are (it comes from working in a charity), we’re sharing our work in the hope that fellow CMS implementors will them useful.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4232 size-full" src="http://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CMS-icon-index2.png" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="http://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CMS-icon-index2-300x198.png 300w, http://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CMS-icon-index2.png 600w" alt="CMS-icon-index" width="600" height="396" /> 

The icons can be <a title="Download EpiServer interface icons" href="http://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/episerver-interface-icons.zip" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>, or are available on a <a title="Episerver interface icons on GitHub" href="https://github.com/mariecurieorguk/episerver-interface-icons" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> in case you want to contribute some additional icons to the set!

<a title="Donate today and help us nurse someone in their final days." href="http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/donate" target="_blank"><strong>If you use them, why not return some kindness by donating some money to our cause.</strong></a>

* The icons are a derivative of an icon set by Michael Reimer from <a title="Best PSD freebies" href="http://www.bestpsdfreebies.com" target="_blank">http://www.bestpsdfreebies.com</a>. If you’re in need of any other icons, you should check out his site.
