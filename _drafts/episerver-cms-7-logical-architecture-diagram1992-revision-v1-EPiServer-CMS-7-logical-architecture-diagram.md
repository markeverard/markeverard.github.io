I often have to describe the logical components of EPiServer CMS to clients and customers. It always feel like I end up recreating a logical architecture diagram on each occasion.

The best place to keep something so that you never lose it, is in a place where it&#8217;s easy to find. Anything on the web is easy to find (thanks Google). I&#8217;ve decided the best place to keep the following EPiServer CMS7 logical architecture diagram is out in the open.
