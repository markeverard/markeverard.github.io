We held the first London EPiServer Meetup last Thursday, and I&#8217;m delighted to report that I had a great time!

Being serious though, I think I can safely say thatÂ everybody who turned up enjoyed themselves and thought the evening worthwhile. The majority (well all actually :)) of the feedback I&#8217;ve received has been positive, and we&#8217;ve definitely gathered enough momentum to make this a regular event on the calendar. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to squeeze another meet-up in &#8211; just before Christmas. If anybody is interested in presenting (or if there are any offers to host the next meetup &#8211; then please get in touch with me). I personally found itÂ genuinelyÂ inspiring to be in the company of developers who are so committed andÂ demonstrablyÂ passionate about their craft.

The program for the first meetup included:[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-319" title="LondonDevMeetup" src="http://markeverard.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7-580x387.jpg 580w, https://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.markeverard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://markeverard.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/x2_319baf7.jpg)

and finally I hosted a informal chat entitled &#8216;Developing with EPiServer&#8217;, where everybody got involved, shared opinions and insights, and collectively we gathered some interesting feedback (which I&#8217;ll be passing onto EPiServer).

Also &#8211; a big thank youÂ to Fortune Cookie for kindly agreeing to host the event.

Roll on next time&#8230;..
