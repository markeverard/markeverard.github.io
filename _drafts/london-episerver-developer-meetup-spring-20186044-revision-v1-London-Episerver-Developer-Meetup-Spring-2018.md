The Episerver Ascend party may have just finished in Las Vegas but that doesnâ€™t mean the fun stops!

Our next Episerver Developer Meetup (London) will be on **Thursday 12th April**. We are being hosted this time by our kind friends at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.co.uk/) who are based in Angel and will make sure there is plenty of food and drink for us.
