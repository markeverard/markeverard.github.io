### I'm a PhD physicist turned technologist. 

Over the past 20 years, I've worked as a developer, architect, team lead and now technology director. I've led, managed and built both small focussed agile teams and large data and technical teams working across the full software delivery lifecycle, in-house and remote.

I've worked agency and client side, helping colleagues and clients across a diverse range of industry sectors meet numerous digital challenges, specifically focusing on web technologies, digital marketing and content management.

I'm an [Episerver Most Valued Professional](https://world.episerver.com/emvp/#emvps) and have a considerable level of product and implementation knowledge built throughout my career.

This site is collection of thoughts and posts that I've written over my  time.

I aspire to write more.
