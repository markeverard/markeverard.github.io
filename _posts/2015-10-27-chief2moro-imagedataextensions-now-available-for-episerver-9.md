Another short, sharp blog post to note that a version of the <a href="https://github.com/markeverard/Chief2moro.ImageDataExtensions" target="_blank">CHIEF2MORO.ImageDataExtensions</a> package which is compatible with EPiServer 9 is now available in the <a href="https://nuget.episerver.com/" target="_blank">EPiServer Nuget Feed</a>. Fellow EMVP <a href="https://github.com/mariajemaria" target="_blank">Marija Jemuovic</a> did all the hard work, and I got the easy part in blogging about it.

There not much more to say, so here is a space filler&#8230;..
