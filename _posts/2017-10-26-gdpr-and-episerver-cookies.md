Many organisations are currently working hard in an effort to be prepared for the incoming [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/resources-and-support/data-protection-self-assessment/getting-ready-for-the-gdpr/) regulations that come into effect [25th May 2018](https://days.to/25-may/2018). The new law heralds a big change for online services in particular, and includes the use of cookies and similar technologies within its remit.

As part of that preparation, organisations are making sure they understand what cookies their websites and digital marketing efforts rely upon, so they can accurately explain these to website visitors and so gain the correct consent for their use (or alternatively they may decide to stop using them)!

What this means is that technical teams are being asked for a full-list of cookies that are used on the sites they maintain. I&#8217;ve been asked for the same list from a number of [our Episerver](https://www.damdigital.com/) clients. [Episerver have some documentation](http://world.episerver.com/documentation/developer-guides/CMS/security/Managing-cookies-on-the-website/) about which cookies are used by their products, but its fragmented over several pages on [Episerver world](http://world.episerver.com/), so I&#8217;ve tried to pull it all together and also included some missing parts around DXC

**I&#8217;ve shared the information in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/markeverard/episerver-cookies)**

1. If you&#8217;re asked for a list of Episerver cookies then feel free to use my [hard work](https://github.com/markeverard/episerver-cookies)
2. If you spot anything missing [send me a pull request](https://github.com/markeverard/episerver-cookies/pull/n  ew/master)
3. If you want to contributeÂ information from any other Episerver products I&#8217;ve not added (Commerce‚ then just [send me a pull-request](https://github.com/markeverard/episerver-cookies/pull/new/master)
