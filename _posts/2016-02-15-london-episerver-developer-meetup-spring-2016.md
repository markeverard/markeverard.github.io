Spring is on its way (think daffodils and lambs) and so is Episerver’s next Developer Meetup.

[Zone](https://www.zonedigital.com/uk/) have very kindly offered to host the meetup at their laid back offices in Kings Cross. And Episerver will be supplying the pizzas and beers – after all, it’s not a meetup without it.

We have a great line up, covering some exciting new features in Episerver and looking at what it coming too

### **Episerver Forms**

In the Winter Release 2016, Episerver Forms were officially released! Finally, a replacement for XForms! Janaka (from Episerver) will talk through different form examples you can build, re-using them, and customized rendering for display channels, personalization, multi-language and permissions. As well as the new four elements added after Beta; Date time, Range, Rich text and URL.

### **Commerce Promotion engine**

New UK EMVP, [Jon Jones](http://jondjones.com), will take us through the new promotions engine in Commerce.**  
** 

### **ASP.NET Core 1**

(AKA ASP.NET 5) There are big changes coming soon to the ASP.NET framework. We&#8217;ll be taken through some of the changes and how Episerver are redesigning the product to take advantage.
