**#Opticon 2022 in San Diego** has ended and I’ve had some space to reflect. Here are my key takeaways.

### 1. Boundless Opportunity
Through COVID, there has been a tremendous amount of change for Optimizely . Multiple product acquisitions and a new brand and identity. San Diego 2022 felt like their coming out party.

I’ve watched their transformation closely and now being with the Optimizely team has shown their genuine excitement, confidence and belief, underpinned by a refined and coherent go-to-market message focussing on business outcome.

It’s very clear the direction Optimizely are heading, how they believe they differentiate in the experience market and why #experimentation will be the engine that drives #boundless digital invention. It is a strong proposition.

### 2. Don’t be Kevin
The full product range encompasses all the tools to enable the modern marketer. From planning, approval and workflow in the Content Marketing product, to insight capture through Web and Feature Experimentation, all underpinned by the Optimizely Data Platform (ODP). 

The product vision was demonstrated in the keynote by Justin Anovick , Kevin Li and Jacob Khan . Pantomime villain Kevin taking the role of a marketer burdened by numerous spreadsheets, offline and inefficient communication, workflow and sign-off. On the other side of the stage, Jacob was the #unlimited hero, utilising the Optimizely stack to quickly deliver data-led outcomes. A light-hearted and powerful showcase for both the potential of the full product suite and Justin’s tailor.

### 3. Connected Platform
A coherent product vision only works if the underlying technology is also connected and interoperable too. Optimizely didn’t shout about #cloud, #composable or other technology buzzwords, because largely they already work from an open architectural footing, with deeper integrations being announced between their #orchestrate and #experiment solutions.

> Still composability is a genuine market concern. 54% of buyers said “Integration capabilities was their top criteria when shopping for cloud software” - martech.org

In response, Optimizely gave further details for their Optimizely Connector Platform (OCP). Planned as an integration platform and marketplace allowing customers and partners to develop point-to-point system integrations for their own unique marketing stack. Each of these connectors will be hosted as isolated #serverless functions by Optimizely. I agree with my fellow #OMVP [Paul de Metter](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/pauldemetter). This was the most exciting announcement at the show.

In summary, thank you to [Alexander Atzberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aatzberger) and everyone at **#Optimizely** for putting on a tremendous event. **32 claps** all round.

**Optimizely customer?** Want to know how to use the above to **#unlimit** yourself and make the most of your investment? Get in touch, I'd love to talk…
