I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been almost a year since our last get-together!

Again the EPiServer landscape has changed a great deal since our last Meetup, with approximately 26 [continuous releases](http://world.episerver.com/releases/) delivered across both CMS, Commerce and Find (and of course the merger with Ektron)

We&#8217;re still finalising talks so stay tuned. If you have something you wish to talk about or contribute, **please do get in touch**.

* Wednesday 3rd June from 6pm
* Shooting Star pub (basement) &#8211; near Liverpool Street &#8211; http://www.shootingstar-city.co.uk/
