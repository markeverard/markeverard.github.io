Hot on the heels of Sydney, we&#8217;ve also got a Meetup planned for London. This time, we&#8217;re hosted by Episerver themselves in their shiny new offices in Central London!

**When** &#8211; Thursday 21st February &#8211; 6pm &#8211; 9pm  
**Where** &#8211; Episerver, 3rd floor Cargo Works  
1-2 Hatfields  
London  
SE19PG 

The latest UK [EMVP](https://world.episerver.com/emvp/) ([Scott Reed](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/scottreed84)) is talking to us about his experience using Commerce and also Episerver will be bringing some of the content about technology features that is being presented at the [Partner Close Up in Stockholm next week](https://www.episerver.com/learn/events/event-listing/partner-close-up/epi-partner-close-up-2019-emea/).

* **Episerver futures**: Episerver technology futures
* **New and interesting in Episerver**: New and interesting features released on the Episerver platform, all available in the latest release
* **Virtual Template System (VTS)**: Best or worst tool in the world?
* **Episerver Commerce** &#8211; the good, the bad and the&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; 

As always, I&#8217;d love for group members to contribute to the discussions, so if you want to tell us something interesting you&#8217;ve read, seen or done lately then we&#8217;ll fire off some lightening talks.

Pizzas and beers will be available, and numbers are limited &#8211; so let us know if you can make it using the Eventbrite page below!
