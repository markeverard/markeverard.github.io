Hopefully this won&#8217;t be news to anyone, as you should have received an email direct from the Episerver developer mailing list. Wait, what do you mean you haven&#8217;t signed up? [Do it now](https://world.episerver.com/System/Users-and-profiles/Register1/)!

## Where and when?
Thanks to [RedWeb](https://www.redweb.com/) who are kindly hosting (and Episerver too), we&#8217;re having another Meetup on the **23rd March 2017**.&nbsp;

## Help us out / lightning talks
I&#8217;m always keen to hear your ideas and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc2B66UTHib4W8l4PiVBnVmunjUwoMqJHE56FTiVvHjQIWPQ/viewform) about our Meetups. Help me out and spend a few minutes to fill in the form below

[Leave us some feedback to help make these Meetups better](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc2B66UTHib4W8l4PiVBnVmunjUwoMqJHE56FTiVvHjQIWPQ/viewform)

I&#8217;m equally as keen to get some contributions for you all. It will always be better if you are willing to share a little of the cool stuff you&#8217;re working on. Just like last time, we&#8217;ve got a slot for some 5 minute &#8216;_Lightning talks&#8217;_. The idea being it&#8217;s a chance to&#8230;&#8230;

1. Tell us about something useful to the community (without the overhead of pulling together a presentation and slides). Why not just crack up Visual Studio and show us a demo, or talk us through a good blog post you&#8217;ve seen.
2. Practise your presentation skills in front of a very friendly audience&#8230;.

We had some good contributions last time. Hopefully we can get a few more this time. If you&#8217;re keen but don&#8217;t know what to talk about then let me (episerver@markeverard.com). I&#8217;ve got a few ideas you can use.

## Don&#8217;t forget to tell us you&#8217;re coming
