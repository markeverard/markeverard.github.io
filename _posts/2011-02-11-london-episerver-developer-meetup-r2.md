After the success of the first <a title="First London EPiServer Developer Meetup" href="http://www.markeverard.com/blog/2010/10/26/first-london-developer-meetup/" target="_blank">London developer Meetup</a>, I&#8217;m happy to announce that we&#8217;ve organised another! Diaries at the ready please&#8230;&#8230;

## When and Where

<a title="LBi&quot;" href="http://www.lbi.co.uk/" target="_blank">LBi</a> have very kindly volunteered to host the event, and will have their legendary beer fridge stocked and ready to go.

  * **Thurs 10th March 2011, 18.30 â€“21.00**
  * **<a href="http://www.meetup.com/EPiServer-London/venue/1045334/?eventId=16504364&popup=true" target="blank">LBi</a> &#8211; Atlantis Building, Truman Brewery London <a title="LBi London - Map" href="http://www.lbi.co.uk/contact/" target="_blank">(Map)</a>**

The full set of talks are yet to be finalised, but I&#8217;m really hopeful of having a set of fantastic speakers for you all (in fact &#8211; if this all comes off I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to top this!).Â The EPiServer UK team will also be there to talk about some of the great new features coming in CMS6 R2.

Again, its up to all of us to make this a success, so ifÂ you have any ideas about any relevant topics, or would like to give a presentation, then please get in touch (mark.everard@fortunecookie.co.uk)

If you&#8217;re interested then please **sign-up** and RSVP using the meetup group below.
