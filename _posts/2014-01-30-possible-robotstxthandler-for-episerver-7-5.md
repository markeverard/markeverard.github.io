A few months back I put together a <a title="A Robots.txt handler for EPiServer 7" href="http://www.markeverard.com/2013/11/01/a-robots-txt-handler-for-episerver-7/" target="_blank">robots.txt handler for EPiServer CMS 7</a>. Technology moves quickly and since then <a title="EPiServer 7.5 CMS a Modern, intuitive, and powerful! " href="http://world.episerver.com/Articles/Items/EPiServer-75-CMS--starting-to-show-its-full-potential/" target="_blank">EPiServer have released CMS version 7.5</a>

My generous ex-colleague Marcin (<a title="wma83 on github" href="https://github.com/wma83" target="_blank">https://github.com/wma83</a>) has forked and updated the package to work with version 7.5. This involved a few minor changes to handle the changes in how sites and site settings are defined.

Its on the Nuget feed already &#8211; [http://nuget.episerver.com/](http://nuget.episerver.com/en/?search=possible&sort=MostDownloads&page=1&pageSize=10) &#8211; search for POSSIBLE.RobotsTxtHandler version 2.0.1
