One of the nice features that came along with the new CMS editing interface from EPiServer 7 is the ability to <a title="Attributes in EPiServer 7 " href="http://world.episerver.com/Documentation/Items/Developers-Guide/EPiServer-CMS/7/Content/Pages-and-Blocks/Attributes/#ImageUrl" target="_blank">define icons</a> for Pages and Blocks. These icons are used within the new editing interface and give editors a more visual way of deciding which is the right content element to use and create in their site.

## Alloy examples
The Alloy Templates starter pack contains a selection of purpose designed images, and demonstrates how useful this can be.

## The reality
The horrible reality that I’ve found is that often designing these icons becomes a low priority task for designers and that the below is an example end result! Which lets be honest, doesn’t really help editors too much.

## A solution
As part of the project we’re working on at the minute at <a title="Marie Curie on GitHub" href="https://github.com/mariecurieorguk" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>, we’ve designed a suite of 55 icons for our own implementation. However, being the nice kind-hearted souls that we are (it comes from working in a charity), we’re sharing our work in the hope that fellow CMS implementors will them useful.

The icons can be <a title="Download EpiServer interface icons" href="/assets/uploads/2014/11/episerver-interface-icons.zip" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>, or are available on a <a title="Episerver interface icons on GitHub" href="https://github.com/mariecurieorguk/episerver-interface-icons" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> in case you want to contribute some additional icons to the set!
