In case you haven&#8217;t heard, we&#8217;re having our <a title="Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/EPiServer-London/events/16504364/" target="_blank">second London Meetup</a> in a few weeks time (10th March) to be precise.

We&#8217;ve now finalised our set of presentations (and its a great set too!).

  * Martin Beeby (Developer Evangelist at Microsoft)   who will be talking to us about the Microsoft MVC framework.
  * David Bowen (Product Manager at EPiServer   specialising in the Commerce product)   who will be showing the new Visitor Groups / Personalisation features coming in R2.
  * Paul Smith (Developer Evangelist at EPiServer)   who will be demonstrating how to work with the Visitor Group API and build your own Vistir group Criteria and also highlighting other changes to the API coming in R2.

It should be a great night. We&#8217;ll look to start as close to 7pm as we can, meaning we can allow plenty of time to relax, network and enjoy <a title="LBi" href="http://www.lbi.co.uk/contact/" target="_blank">LBi&#8217;s</a> generous hospitality!

Hope to see you there ~ Mark
