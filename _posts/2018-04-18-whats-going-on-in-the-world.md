As Episerver has grown, so has the developer community. It now stands at just over 40,000 members.

A community this big creates a lot of good content, which alongside the more frequent news from Episerver (releases updates, articles and documentation) means it&#8217;s becoming easy to miss useful stuff on Episerver World that may help you or your clients.

At the London Meetup last week I announced my attempt to help out and highlight the best and most interesting content from [Episerver World](https://world.episerver.com/), [Asp.Net](https://www.asp.net/) and Web development.

### What&#8217;s going on in the World?

Regular curated Episerver news direct to you inbox. My take on whats interesting, valuable, and worth your time to read a little further. I hope you&#8217;ll sign up and find it useful.
