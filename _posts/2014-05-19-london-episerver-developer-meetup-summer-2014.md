Many of you have been asking when the next London EPiServer Developer Meetup would be&#8230;&#8230; If you keep reading then you&#8217;ll find out (spoiler &#8211; its **Tuesday 10th June**)

It&#8217;s been a year since we last met and there is much to catch up on. As we were all getting to grips with version 7, EPiServer released <a title="EPiServer 7.5 release notes" href="http://world.episerver.com/Documentation/Items/Release-Notes/Release-notes---EPiServer-75/" target="_blank">7.5</a>, including a new way to handle media files. There has been further large feature enhancements and consolidation and integration of the Commerce product, and a move to near continuous delivery; with new features for all products being delivered direct to our doorsteps (aka <a title="EPiServer Nuget Feed" href="http://nuget.episerver.com/" target="_blank">Nuget</a> feeds) every few weeks.

To help us find out all of the latest news, EPiServer have sent some of their top techys across from Sweden to tell us all about it &#8211; (thanks to all who made this possible).

We&#8217;ve got a very full programme of talks, networking and refreshements so we&#8217;re planning on starting a little earlier at 6pm at our friends <a title="Nansen in London" href="http://www.nansen.com/en/contact-us/london/" target="_blank">Nansen</a>.

**1. _Chris Sharp, Nansen &#8211; Commerce 7.5 Markets_**  
Configuration, customization, development, usages, and purposes of the Commerce 7.5 market system.​

**2. _Magnus Stråle, EPiServer_**  
Commerce & MVC – some simple patterns. Also, Frequent EPiServer releases – how & why.

**3. _Shahram Shahinzadeh &#8211; Visual Studio integration and Azure_**  
Intro to the new Visual Studio integration based on NuGet and installing EPiServer CMS sites with one click. Also, highlighting which EPiServer modules changed because of Cloud considerations (DB, Event provider, blob provider, cloud license, etc.).

Those details for your diaries.

* Tues 10th June 2014, 18.00– 20.30ish
* Nansen – 109-111 Farringdon Road, London – (<a title="Nansen in London" href="http://www.nansen.se/en/contact-us/london/" target="_blank">directions</a>)
