I often have to describe the logical components of EPiServer CMS to clients and customers. It always feel like I end up recreating a logical architecture diagram on each occasion.

The best place to keep something so that you never lose it, is in a place where it&#8217;s easy to find. Anything on the web is easy to find (thanks Google). I&#8217;ve decided the best place to keep the following EPiServer CMS7 logical architecture diagram is out in the open.

The added benefit of this for everybody else, is that I&#8217;m happy for you to use my work. If any of you are <a title="Flow Chart Maker and Online Diagram Software" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/" target="_blank">LucidChart</a> users then I&#8217;m happy to share the original with you so that you can apply any further modifications.
