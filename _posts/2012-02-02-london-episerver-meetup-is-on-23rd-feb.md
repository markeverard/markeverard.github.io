We&#8217;re back for 2012. We&#8217;ll be having our first 2012 <a title="EPiServer developers in London" href="http://www.meetup.com/EPiServer-London/" target="_blank">London EPiServer Developer Meetup</a>, hosted at <a title="Digital Agency London" href="http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk" target="_blank">Fortune Cookie</a> on **Thursday 23rd February.**

****Coming to talk to us this time will be:

  * <a title="Meridium develop and distribute unique off the shelf add-on's for EPiServer and Microsoft SharePoint, resulting in a more powerful, efficient and easy to use plattform. " href="http://www.meridium.se/en/" target="_blank">Meridium</a> &#8211; who will be telling us all about the latest version of <a title="ImageVault" href="http://www.meridium.se/en/products/imagevault/overview/" target="_blank">ImageVault</a> &#8211; which is image and digital asset management module for EPiServer.
  * <a title="Joel Abrahamsson" href="http://joelabrahamsson.com/" target="_blank">Joel Abrahamsson</a> &#8211; who should need little introduction. Joel has been instrumental in helping to improve the EPiServer development experience &#8211; through his open source projects such as <a title="Page Type Builder for EPiServer CMS" href="http://pagetypebuilder.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">PageTypeBuilder</a> and <a title="EPiAbstractions" href="http://epiabstractions.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">EPiAbstractions</a> (amongst others). Tonight though Joel will be wearing a different hat as he&#8217;ll be talking about his latest project. <a title="Truffler - an advanced search engine service" href="http://truffler.net/" target="_blank">Truffler.Net</a> &#8211; an advanced search engine and C# API
  * Plus &#8211; some other (to be confirmed) talks from our community members

We will start **presentations promptly at 7pm** so please aim to get there for **6:30pm**

There will be some food and drinks (kindly provided by <a title="EPiServer - software to build your online presence" href="http://www.episerver.com/" target="_blank">EPiServer</a> UK) and plenty of opportunity to network and talk tech.

<a title="EPiServer Developer Meetup Spring 2012" href="http://www.meetup.com/EPiServer-London/events/50703712/" target="_blank">Full details are on the Meetup page</a> where you can sign up and RSVP to confirm attendance.

I hope you&#8217;ll agree that its a great program and also I think we&#8217;re incredibly lucky to have both Meridium and Joel flying over from Sweden to come and talk to us. Please show your support.

See you all on the 23rd.
