Below are the three presentations we had from the <a title="London EPiServer Meetup Summer 2013" href="http://www.markeverard.com/2013/05/23/london-episerver-meetup-summer-2013/" target="_blank">London EPiServer Meetup Summer 2013</a> hosted at [Syzygy](http://www.syzygy.co.uk/ "Syzygy"). Thanks to all that came and especially to Youtse @EPiServer for organising refreshments, and to Fabio and Syzygy for being generous hosts and of course to Phil and Mark who presented.
